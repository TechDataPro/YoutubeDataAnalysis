# YoutubeDataAnalysis
On this project I will work on these Analysis:  

How long usually a video can trend in different countries? 

which category has longer trend? 

Most common words(Trending words) in video titles 

which category has highest ratio of Likes-Dislikes and Views-Comments. 


This is the project I wanted to focus on: sentiment analysis and how YouTubers can actually make the most use of their data, like the comments they receive 
on each video they publish. It took me a month to wrap up this project, and I believe the outcome is brilliant as it showcases all the details of 
sentimental behaviors behind the scenes. This highlights the power of data science.
